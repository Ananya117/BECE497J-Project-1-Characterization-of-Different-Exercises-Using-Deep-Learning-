Video-based upper-body exercise analysis system using MediaPipe pose estimation. Extracts joint angles and kinematic metrics (displacement, velocity, acceleration, jerk), applies FFT and Butterworth filtering, segments repetitions, and analyses fatigue and form deviations through biomechanical and ML techniques.
